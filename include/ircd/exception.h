/** The root exception type.
 *
 *  All exceptions in the project inherit from this type.
 *  To catch any exception from a project developer's code:
 *    catch(const ircd::exception &) {}
 *
 *  Remember: not all exceptions are from project developer's code,
 *  such as std::out_of_range. In most contexts if you have to deal with this
 *  someone else was lazy, which is bad. To be sure and catch any exception:
 *    catch(const std::exception &) {}
 *
 *  Remember: not all exceptions have to inherit from std::exception, but
 *  those are rogue exceptions. We do not allow this. To be sure nothing
 *  can possibly get through, add to the bottom:
 *    catch(...) {}
 *
 *  Note: Prefer 'noexcept' instead of catch(...), noexcept is like an 'assert'
 *  for exceptions, and the rogue can be found-out in testing.

// Disambiguates the constructors in the macro below.

/** Exception generator convenience macro
 *
 *  If you want to create your own exception type, you have found the right
 *  place! This macro allows creating an exception in the the hierarchy.
 *
 *  To create an exception, invoke this macro in your header. Examples:
 *
 *     IRCD_EXCEPTION(ircd::exception, my_exception)
 *     IRCD_EXCEPTION(my_exception, my_specific_exception)
 *
 *  Then your catch sequence can look like the following:
 *
 *     catch(const my_specific_exception &e)
 *     {
 *         log("something specifically bad happened: %s", e.what());
 *     }
 *     catch(const my_exception &e)
 *     {
 *         log("something generically bad happened: %s", e.what());
 *     }
 *     catch(const ircd::exception &e)
 *     {
 *         log("unrelated bad happened: %s", e.what());
 *     }
 *     catch(const std::exception &e)
 *     {
 *         log("unhandled bad happened: %s", e.what());
 *     }
 *
 *  Remember: the order of the catch blocks is important.
